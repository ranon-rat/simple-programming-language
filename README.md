# SPL (Simple Programming Language)

A minimal programming language interpreter written in Rust.

## About

This project is a learning exercise designed to deepen my understanding of Rust and the inner workings of interpreters. SPL is inspired by [bc](https://www.gnu.org/software/bc/manual/html_mono/bc.html), though it omits features like command execution for simplicity and security.

## Project Status

This is a prototype and not intended for long-term maintenance. Once the example programs run correctly and no obvious bugs remain, I'll consider the project complete and move on to new challenges.

## Future Considerations

While the current scope is intentionally limited, potential additions include:

- **Module system**: Basic support for code organization across files
- **Arrays**.
- **FFI (Foreign Function Interface)**: While interesting, this would likely be better implemented in a C++ version of the interpreter
