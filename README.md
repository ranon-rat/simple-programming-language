# SPL(simple programming language)

This is a simple programming language made in rust.
The only objective that I have with this project 
is to learn more about rust and improve my understanding 
on how interpreters work under the hood.

This is a simple prototype, its not something that I plan to mantain. 
Once the examples are runnable, and there is no findable bug
I will move to a next project.

This is based [bc](https://www.gnu.org/software/bc/manual/html_mono/bc.html), obviously without things like command execution.

One of the things that I may add later on, will be some simple support for modules and other stuff.
FFI its definitely something that I would like to try but in that case it would be much better to just use c++ to write this interpreter.
